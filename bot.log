### Key Tips for Your PDF Report

The assignment asks for a `report.pdf`. Since I cannot generate a PDF, here is the content you should put in a Word doc and save as PDF:

1.  **Architecture Overview:** Explain that you used a modular design (separating logic into `src/`) to ensure the code is scalable and that `main.py` acts only as a controller.
2.  **Screenshots:** Run the bot 3 times (Market, Limit, TWAP). Take screenshots of your terminal output and screenshot the `bot.log` file showing the entries.
3.  **Bonus Explanation:** Specifically highlight the `src/advanced/` folder. Explain that you implemented **TWAP** to reduce market impact for large orders and **Stop-Limit** for risk management.
